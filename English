# PANDORA
That name in honor of my brother and friend @ofjaaah | TheKingsOfBounty Team | Because with him everything is a surprise .... lol

Taking advantage of the cue I made an adaptation of one of OneLine, which we use frequently in our bounty search activities and in our corporate day-to-day activities.

The purpose here was to automate some phases of RECON, in my corporate activities I use a lot.

For the proper functioning, it is important:

AMASS - https://github.com/OWASP/Amass

CHAOS - https://github.com/projectdiscovery/chaos-client
This tool needs to register the API
export CHAOS_KEY = CHAOS_API_KEY

ASSETFINDER -https: //github.com/tomnomnom/assetfinder

SUBFINDER -https: //github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder

FINDOMAIN -https: //github.com/Findomain/Findomain

GITHUB-RESEARCH - https://github.com/gwen001/github-search
This tool needs to have the API registered in github, in the pandora binary, it has the right place to place the API Key.
